# Experimenting with transducers

This project illustrates Clojure's transducers and some things to consider when creating new transducers.
Additional details are provided in the accompanying blog post: https://blog.cofx.nl/to-transduce-or-not-to-transduce.

If you're a beginner to Clojure and don't have a favorite setup yet,
give [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in combination with the [Calva extension](https://calva.io/) a try.

Once you've installed Visual Studio Code and Calva,
[connect Calva to the project](https://calva.io/connect/) using the project type `deps.edn`, open `src/transduce.clj`, and start evaluating expressions using `alt+enter`.
